A quick example of how you can Output data to the sound chip,
using only SCMonitor. This example sets channel A to generate a
fixed frequency tone, all other channels and noise-generators are off:

SCMon command   	Description
o 33 7			Select Mixer register
o 32 ff			All mixer channels off

o 33 8			Select Channel A Volume register
o 32 9			Fixed Volume = 9 (01001 binary)

o 33 9			Select Channel B Volume register
o 32 0			Fixed Volume = 0

o 33 a			Select Channel C Volume register
o 32 0			Fixed Volume = 0

o 33 1			Select Channel A frequency, coarse tune
o 32 1			Rough tone adjust = 1

o 33 0			Select Channel A frequency, fine tune
o 32 ff			Fine tone adjust = ff

o 33 7			Select Mixer register
o 32 fe			Turn on Channel A Tone only

The same example as above, but without descriptions (to make copy/paste easy)
o 33 7
o 32 ff
o 33 8
o 32 9
o 33 9
o 32 0
o 33 a
o 32 0
o 33 1
o 32 1
o 33 0
o 32 ff
o 33 7
o 32 fe

The same example as above, but moved the ports to 42 & 43 to avoid conflict with Z80 Memory Card
o 43 7
o 42 ff
o 43 8
o 42 9
o 43 9
o 42 0
o 43 a
o 42 0
o 43 1
o 42 1
o 43 0
o 42 ff
o 43 7
o 42 fe

A short-hand for the used registers follow. For more details about what the
registers do, read the data sheets in the Documentation directory. 


Registers 0+1, 2+3 and 4+5 are Tone generator register pairs, Ch A/B/C resp.
	Even register is Fine tune, Odd register is Coarse tune

Registers 8,9,A are the Level registers for channel A, B and C respectively.
	1 bit mode, 4 bits of volume. The mode bit selects fixed/dynamic

Register 7 is the Mixer register.
Here are some values for the Mixer register to make selection of the different
Tone generators easy:
 Binary		Hex	Selects:
 1111 1111 	FF	<- All off
 1111 1110 	FE	<- Ch A tone solo
 1111 1101 	FD	<- Ch B tone solo
 1111 1011 	FB	<- Ch C tone solo

 1111 1100 	FC	<- A + B
 1111 1010 	FA	<- A + C
 1111 1001 	F9	<- B + C
 1111 1000 	F8	<- A + B + C 

Mixer bit map:
|     IO    |  Noise channels |  Tone channels  |
| IOB | IOA |  C  |  B  |  A  |  C  |  B  |  A  |

Mixer bits are "low active", so 0xFF is "All off", while
0xC0 is "All audio channels and noise on".
