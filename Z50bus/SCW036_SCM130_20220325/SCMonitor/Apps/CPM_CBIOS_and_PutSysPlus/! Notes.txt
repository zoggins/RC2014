This folder contains a means to build custom versions of the CP/M 2.2
CBIOS and then create a CP/M installation program (PutSysPlus) with
the custom CBIOS embedded in it.

1/ Edit Configure.asm to configure the CBIOS
2/ Assemble CBIOS.asm
3/ Assemble PutSysPlus.asm

The resulting code is in SCWorkshop\Output named IntelHex.hex

To install the version of CP/M created:

1/ Format the CompactFlash card using the SCM CompactFlash Format App 
2/ Send IntelHex.hex file to SCM
3/ Execute it with the SCM command "G 8000"

CP/M can then be started with the SCM command "CPM".


Technical notes:
SCM S5 did have Z180 base = 0x40, now 0xC0
