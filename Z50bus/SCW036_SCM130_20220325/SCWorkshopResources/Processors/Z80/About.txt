About Z80 processor

The Z80 was one of the most popular 8-bit processors during 
the late 70s and most of the 80s.

One of its strengths is the ability to run CP/M, which was 
probably the only general purpose portable operating system 
for 8-bit processors in the 70s.

It was used in many of the iconic computers of the era.
