This is a theoretic computer only. It does not really exist.

It is designed to allow experimentation and learning via this program's simulator.

This simulated computer is well equiped with simple input and output devices making 
it quite a flexible learning tool.

It is also a good environment to develop much of the code needed for a real computer.
